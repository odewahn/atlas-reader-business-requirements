<h1>Feature Description</h1>

<p>Central Content Storage will provide a destination repository for all transformed content that will be through the Atlas Reader, indexed by Full Content Search, or other content distribution related initiatives. &nbsp;In addition to raw storage, the CCS will provide a unified API for dealing with content that is keyed to other metadata systems within O'Reilly. &nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Key requirements include:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li>Storage support for Atlas HTML builds and EPUB. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Ability to store hierarchical content (i.e., folders) and not just flat structures.</li>
	<li>Ability to &quot;attach&quot; the storage to instances running various client apps, like the Reader.</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Non-Requirements include:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li>Sophisticated ACL. &nbsp;The initial implementation will not include an ACL system for groups, users, organizations, or teams. &nbsp;It is assumed that client apps will mount the CCS as a root volume and handle ACL at the application level. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Caching. &nbsp;Caching and other performance related system will be handled at the application layer</li>
	<li>Direct content serving. &nbsp;Content will not be served directly; it can only be served by a client app running on an attached server.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Success Criteria</h1>

<p>To be a success, this project must:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Store at least 80% of O'Reilly Frontlist titles by the end of 2014</li>
	<li>Store at least 80% of the EPUBs from distribution partners</li>
	<li>Provide a central content repository that can serve the Full Content Search project</li>
	<li>Provide cost effective storage and bandwith</li>
</ul>

<h1>Maximum Level of Development Effort</h1>

<p>Assuming we use AWS, this is a relatively straightforward to set up and will not require any development time. &nbsp;We'll need to take the appropriate security roles and settings.</p>
