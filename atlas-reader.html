<h1>Feature Description</h1>

<p>The Atlas Reader provides a client gateway into the content in the CCS. &nbsp;Key requirements are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ability to render themed HTML builds generated in Atlas</li>
	<li>Ability to render EPUB (via a tool like epub.js) [explore if the <a class="link" href="http://blog.workhere.io/googlebots-recent-improvements-might-revolutionize-web-development/">new changes in the googlebot</a> make this a feasible delivery format]</li>
	<li>Ability to browse these with beautiful splash pages</li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Whitelisting for searchbots, like Google or the full content search project to index all of the content in the reader&nbsp;</span></li>
	<li>Ability to show preview for users coming from Google or other social media channels. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Ensure compliance with Google's <a class="link " href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/12/changes-in-first-click-free.html">first click free&nbsp;</a>program.</li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Ability to log in with Janrain</span></li>
	<li>Ability to allow/disallow access based on O'Reilly <a href="https://intranet.oreilly.com/confluence/display/IS/Ownership+Service+Documentation#OwnershipServiceDocumentation-RetrieveOwnershipAssociationsBetweenCustomersandProducts">ownership service</a> API</li>
	<li>Ability to generate a &quot;mega index page&quot; that lists canonical links to all content in the CCS. &nbsp;This should be accessible to the search crawlers. &nbsp;(Note that these can be paged, with &quot;next&quot; and &quot;prev&quot; links that the crawlers will follow.)</li>
	<li>Appropriate caching for performance</li>
</ul>

<p>Non Requirements include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>PDF rendering. &nbsp;PDF will be extremely challenging to render, so we will not natively display PDF in the reader. &nbsp;Instead, we will convert PDF to HTMLBook. &nbsp;The reader will still be able to get the original PDF, but the reader will aid in discovery and findability.</li>
	<li>Paragraph-level annotations. &nbsp;Data indicates that the paragraph level commenting in Chimera was not worth the time and effort spent developing them. &nbsp;Instead, we will seek alternative discussion frameworks, either through Disqus or other annotation plug-ins.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Uniform styling for EPUB. &nbsp;Because we cannot control the source markup provided by distribution clients, we cannot develop uniform stylesheets against their markup. &nbsp;Consequently, our best option is to render content in the style they provide. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</section>

<h1>Success Criteria</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Increased content sales and discovery</li>
	<li>Enable paid distribution of new content types and forms created in Atlas reader, particularly video and<a class="link " href="http://odewahn.github.io/grossman-test/ch02.html#arrays"> live code</a>.</li>
	<li>Enabling user facing previews for content search project</li>
	<li>Enable &quot;members only&quot; content that is accessible to customers who have enrolled in oreilly &quot;members only&quot; products [TBD]&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Increase inbound referrals and conversion rates from social media (Twitter, etc) that can take advantage of new &quot;preview&quot; functionality</li>
</ul>

<section data-type="sect1">
<h1>Maximum Level of Development Effort</h1>

<p>XLarge. &nbsp;We'll need to break this BRD down into many smaller feature requirements.</p>
