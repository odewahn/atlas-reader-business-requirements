<h1>Feature Description</h1>

<p><em>ENTER FEATURE DESCRIPTION HERE</em></p>

<p><em>FEATURE DESCRIPTION TYPICALLY CONSISTS OF AN EXPLANATORY PARAGRAPH OR TWO</em></p>

<p><em>AND ENDS WITH A BULLET LIST LIKE THIS:</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Ability to render HTML5 and EPUB (via a tool like epub.js)</li>
	<li>Ability to browse these projects with beautiful splash pages</li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Ability for Google to index all of the content in the reader&nbsp;</span></li>
	<li>Ability to show preview for users coming from Google based on&nbsp;their&nbsp;<a class="link " href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/12/changes-in-first-click-free.html">first click free&nbsp;</a>program.</li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Ability to log in with Janrain</span></li>
	<li>Ability to allow/disallow access based on O'Reilly <a href="https://intranet.oreilly.com/confluence/display/IS/Ownership+Service+Documentation#OwnershipServiceDocumentation-RetrieveOwnershipAssociationsBetweenCustomersandProducts">ownership service</a> API</li>
</ul>

<p>Non Requirements include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>PDF rendering. &nbsp;PDF will be extermely challenging to render, so we will not natively display PDF in the reader. &nbsp;Instead, we will convert PDF to HTMLBook. &nbsp;The reader will still be able to get the original PDF, but the reader will aid in discovery and findability.</li>
	<li>Paragraph-level annotations. &nbsp;Data indicates that the paragraph level commenting in Chimera was not worth the time and effort spent developing them. &nbsp;Instead, we will seek alternative discussion frameworks, either through Disqus or other annotation plug-ins.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Uniform styling for EPUB. &nbsp;Because we cannot control the source markup provided by distribution clients, we cannot develop uniform stylesheets against their markup. &nbsp;Consequently, our best option is to render content in the style they provide. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
