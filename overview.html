<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>This document contains the business requirements documents (BRDs) for the &quot;Atlas Reader&quot; project. &nbsp;The goal of the document is to provide a central point for collecting and discussing features for the reader and the related initiatives, such as full content search .</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To write a new BRD for a feature, create a new file named after the feature (e.g. better-analytics.html), and copy/paste the contents of COPYME.html into your new document (yes, we need file templates). When you're done writing, put the filename underneath the feature description in the backlog.</p>

<p>Before every product council meeting, the council leader will look through the parking lot for new BRD's, and we will discuss the priority of these features. Instead of going through the entire parking lot every time, we will only discuss features with new BRD's, and how they relate to the existing prioritized features.</p>
