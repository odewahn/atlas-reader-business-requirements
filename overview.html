<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>This document contains the business requirements documents (BRDs) for the &quot;Atlas Reader&quot; project. &nbsp;The goal of the document is to provide a central point for collecting and discussing features for the reader and the related initiatives, such as full content search . &nbsp;It is also meant to be used as a focal point for the &quot;Atlas Reader Product Council,&quot; whose members will be made up of various stakeholders. &nbsp;The council will have monthly meetings to discuss new BRDs and the general status of the project.</p>

<div data-type="note">
<h1>Submitting a BRD</h1>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">To write a new BRD for a feature, create a new file named after the feature (e.g. better-analytics.html), and copy/paste the contents of COPYME.html into your new document (yes, we need file templates). &nbsp;B</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">efore every product council meeting, the council leader will look through the parking lot for new BRD's, and we will discuss the priority of these features. Instead of going through the entire parking lot every time, we will only discuss features with new BRD's, and how they relate to the existing prioritized features.</span></p>

<p>The key elements in the system are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Central Content Store (CCS). &nbsp;A central storage spot for content that will be served by the Atlas Reader or Full Content Search.</li>
	<li>Atlas Web Publisher. &nbsp;An API/UI for loading Atlas HTML Builds or EPUBs into the CCS. &nbsp;The Web Publisher will also provide a light metadata service.</li>
	<li>Atlas Reader. &nbsp;The gateway app that serves content from the CSC. &nbsp;There are two main paths: whitelisted and gated. &nbsp;Whitelisted paths expose content to search indexes, like Google or the internal full content search project. &nbsp;Gated access serves content to users based on their permissions in the ProductCustomer Service.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
